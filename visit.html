            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> In sports we
                learn to relate ourselves with other people who have similar interest and a common goal to
                achieve. It does not matter the sport, whether it is an individual or a team sport, there are always
                people around us that get directly or indirectly to make it possible.
                Despite the most visual part of the sports, there are also things that are not as easily seen and
                require a huge amount of work. The bigger the club is the more increases the effort required for
                this task, and having the data organized and accessible is fundamental.</p>
            <h3>Purpose of the Sport Club Program </h3>
            <p>The Sport Club program at Xavier International College offers the community an opportunity to participate
                in a
                broad variety of sports and recreational activities. All programs are based on members' interest and
                designed to enhance the experience by creating an environment where students can unite in
                diverse groups to achieve common goals and objectives while encouraging healthy lifestyles. Sport
                Clubs provide a valuable learning experience through student involvement in fundraising, public
                relations, organization, administration, budgeting, scheduling, teaching, and leadership development.
                The clubs with the most success and stability are those with active members and dedicated officers</p>
